# remoteStorage modules

This is the official repository for remoteStorage community modules.

### Work in progress!

We're currently in the process of adding, updating, and polishing the core
modules. Experimental and unfinished modules live in a respective branch named
after the module name (prefixed with `dev/`).

If you want to help or learn more about how modules work, just hop on the IRC
channel and say hello: [irc://irc.freenode.net:7000/remotestorage](irc://irc.freenode.net:7000/remotestorage)

We also introduced new community forums (including a modules category), where
you can ask and discuss anything: [http://community.remotestorage.io](http://community.remotestorage.io).

### Getting your code into the master branch

Just issue a pull request, and we'll jointly review the code and help each
other making it ready for master.
